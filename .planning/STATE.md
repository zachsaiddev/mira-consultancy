## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Calendly for CTAs: Removes need to build contact form, lowers friction for booking calls
- Dark/monochrome palette: Matches design references, feels premium and personal
- Subtle animations only: Restrained motion keeps focus on content, faster to build
- No CMS: Static content is simpler, faster, and sufficient for v1
- Single-page landing: All content on one page, future sections as separate routes
- Tailwind v4 @theme: Better type safety and co-location vs v3 config (01-01)
- #7a7a7a tertiary text: WCAG AA compliant (4.6:1) vs original #737373 (4.2:1) (01-01)
