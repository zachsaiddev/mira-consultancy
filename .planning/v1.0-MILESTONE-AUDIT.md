## Tech Debt

### Bug (Cosmetic)

1. **Button arrow animation** (Phase 02) — `group-hover:translate-x-1` on the arrow span requires a `group` class on the parent Button element. Missing from the `cn()` call. Arrow never slides on hover. Fix: add `group` to Button className.

### Dead Code

2. **Tech icon React components** (Phase 03) — 6 SVG React components in `components/icons/tech/` are orphaned. The tools display was reimplemented using SVG files from `/public/images/logos/` instead. The barrel export exists but has zero consumers.

### Inconsistencies

3. **ToolsColumn not in UI barrel** (Phase 03.1/04) — Imported via direct path in layout.tsx. Functional but inconsistent with the barrel pattern used by all other UI components.

4. **About.tsx unnecessary 'use client'** (Phase 04) — Has the directive but uses no hooks or browser APIs. Adds marginal bundle weight.

5. **CaseStudy/ProBonoItem bypass Zod** (Phase 03) — These types use plain TypeScript interfaces + `satisfies` instead of Zod schemas. Compile-time only validation, inconsistent with the schema pattern used for Service/ProcessStep/Differentiator.

### Missing Verification

6. **Phase 03.1 and Phase 04** have no VERIFICATION.md files. However, all 6 plans in these phases have SUMMARY.md files confirming completion, and the integration checker confirmed all cross-phase wiring is intact.

### Known Limitation

7. **favicon.ico 404** on GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment — browser requests root-domain favicon. Needs custom domain to fix.

## Verdict

**All 25 requirements satisfied. All E2E flows complete. No critical blockers.**

The tech debt is minor — a cosmetic animation bug, some dead code, and a few inconsistencies. None affect the site's ability to communicate credibility, showcase services, and drive visitors to book calls (the core value).

**Recommendation:** Proceed with milestone completion. Address Button arrow bug and dead code cleanup in v1.1 or as quick fixes before completing.
