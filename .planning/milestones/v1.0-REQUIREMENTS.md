- **NEWS-01**: Email newsletter signup

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Contact form | Using Calendly integration instead — lower friction |
| CMS integration | Static content sufficient for v1; premature complexity |
| Multi-page navigation | Single-page layout; sections use anchor links |
| Live chat widget | Adds overhead, slows site, Calendly handles intake |
| Pricing calculator | Consultancy pricing is custom; "contact for quote" approach |
| Social media feeds | External dependency, can break, looks dated |
| Auto-playing video | Accessibility issue, bandwidth cost |
| GSAP / heavy animation libraries | Overkill for subtle animations; Intersection Observer sufficient |
| OAuth / authentication | Brochure site, no user accounts needed |
| Dark/light mode toggle | Dark-only design per design direction |
