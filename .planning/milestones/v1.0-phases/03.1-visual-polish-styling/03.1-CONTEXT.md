# Phase 3.1: Visual Polish & Styling - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Elevate the site's visual presentation beyond flat dark background — add depth, texture, and refined styling to existing sections. No new sections or content. Must be rollback-safe (own git branch).

## Implementation Decisions

### Background & depth
- Gradient base + film grain/noise texture overlay — both layered together
- Uniform background treatment across all sections (no alternating tones)
- Editorial/magazine visual direction (think Monocle, Bloomberg) — sophisticated, text-forward with subtle textures
- Refinement level: "Refined but visible" — clearly elevated, visitors notice the polish without it feeling flashy

### Section visual rhythm
- Service and process items separated by thin horizontal ruled lines between each item — magazine index/newspaper layout feel
- Current section dividers (border-text-tertiary/10) are invisible on dark background — need to be fixed (stronger opacity or replaced)
- Tech stack section stays as minimal icon row — no card/pill treatment
- About section photo: edges fade/blend into background — editorial magazine style

### Typography & color accents
- Cool subtle accent color (muted blue or teal) for select elements — CTAs, hover states
- Tighter letter-spacing on h1/h2 headings — editorial punch, condensed tracking
- Section labels keep current muted style (small, uppercase, tertiary) — no changes
- Hero headline: larger and bolder — make it a real statement piece, commanding first impression

### Micro-interactions & hover effects
- CTA hover: text shifts to accent color — simple, no underline animation
- Service/process items: description text brightens on hover, heading stays same
- Footer social icons: keep current opacity change (muted → full)
- Scroll animations: add parallax-lite effects — some elements move at different scroll speeds for depth

### Rollback strategy
- Execute on its own git branch so changes can be reverted cleanly if the visual direction doesn't land

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact gradient angle and color stops
- Grain texture intensity and implementation (CSS vs SVG filter)
- Specific accent color shade (muted blue or teal family)
- Parallax scroll speed ratios
- Photo fade/blend technique (CSS mask-image vs gradient overlay)

## Specific Ideas

- Editorial/magazine reference: Monocle, Bloomberg — sophisticated, text-forward, subtle textures
- Ruled lines between items like a magazine index layout
- Photo blending into background (editorial portrait style)
- Hero should feel commanding — bigger, heavier type
