# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03.1-01
    provides: Design tokens (accent color, h1 5xl/editorial-tracking base rule, film grain)

provides:
  - Magazine-style ruled lines between Services items via divide-y divide-text-tertiary/20
  - Magazine-style ruled lines between Process items via divide-y divide-text-tertiary/20
  - Hover brightness effect on description text in Services and Process
  - About photo fade-into-background via CSS radial-gradient maskImage
  - Hero h1 font-bold class for commanding 700-weight headline

affects:
  - 03.1-03 (parallax and client-side Hero enhancements)

# Tech tracking

    - "divide-y divide-text-tertiary/20: Tailwind utility for magazine-index horizontal rules between flex/grid children"

  - "first:pt-0 last:pb-0: Removes asymmetric padding at list boundaries, keeping visual alignment with section headers"
  - "Heading stays unchanged on hover (only description brightens): Locked decision from 03.1-01 research"
  - "maskImage radial-gradient ellipse 85% 85% at 50% 40%: Center slightly above-center (40%) suits portrait photos where face is upper portion; transparent at 80% gives soft fade"
  - "Removed rounded-lg from About photo: Rounded corners conflict with radial fade aesthetic"

patterns-established:
  - "Magazine list pattern: divide-y divide-text-tertiary/20 with py-8 first:pt-0 last:pb-0 group cursor-default per item"

# Phase 03.1 Plan 02: Visual Polish — Content Sections Summary

**Magazine-style divide-y ruled lines with hover brightness in Services/Process, radial-gradient maskImage portrait fade in About, and font-bold hero headline**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-17T10:10:53Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-17T10:11:53Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Services and Process sections now have thin horizontal ruled lines between each item (Tailwind `divide-y divide-text-tertiary/20`) with consistent `py-8` spacing
- Description text brightens to `text-text-primary` on hover via `group`/`group-hover` pattern; headings remain unchanged per locked decision
- About section photo wrapper uses CSS `maskImage` + `WebkitMaskImage` radial-gradient to soft-fade photo edges into the dark background (editorial portrait treatment)
- Hero `<h1>` carries explicit `font-bold` class, reinforcing 700 weight alongside the 5xl size and editorial tracking from Plan 01 base rules

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Ruled lines and hover states — Services and Process** - `8ed6fa7` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Photo mask fade — About; bold headline — Hero** - `38fb3ed` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `components/sections/Services.tsx` — Replaced `space-y-10` with `divide-y divide-text-tertiary/20`; added `group cursor-default` per item; added `group-hover:text-text-primary transition-colors duration-200` to description
- `components/sections/Process.tsx` — Same pattern as Services with process step items
- `components/sections/About.tsx` — Replaced `rounded-lg overflow-hidden bg-text-tertiary/10` with `overflow-hidden` + `maskImage`/`WebkitMaskImage` inline radial-gradient style
- `components/sections/Hero.tsx` — Added `font-bold` class to `<h1>`

## Decisions Made

- `divide-y` over `space-y-10` for Services/Process: Tailwind divide-y adds `border-top` on every child except first automatically, producing clean index-style horizontal rules without extra wrapper markup
- Only description text brightens on hover, headings stay unchanged: Locked decision from 03.1-01 research (per RESEARCH.md and 03.1-01 decisions)
- `radial-gradient(ellipse 85% 85% at 50% 40%, black 40%, transparent 80%)`: Center offset to 40% vertical suits portrait photos with face in upper portion; `transparent` at 80% gives gradual fade without hard edge
- Removed `rounded-lg` from About photo wrapper: Rounded corners conflict with radial fade aesthetic — the fade effect itself defines the photo boundary

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- All four core content sections are visually polished with editorial magazine treatment
- Plan 03 (parallax and Hero scroll animation) can proceed — Hero.tsx remains a server component as specified, ready for `'use client'` promotion in Plan 03
- Services/Process magazine list pattern established for reuse if more list sections are added
