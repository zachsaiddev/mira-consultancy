# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 03-core-content-sections
    provides: page.tsx with section structure and hr dividers
provides:
  - Gradient + grain background system via body and body::before
  - Muted steel blue accent token (#7a9eb8, WCAG AA ~5.5:1)
  - --font-size-5xl and --tracking-editorial CSS tokens
  - h1 override: 5xl size, editorial tracking (-0.035em), weight 700
  - h2 override: editorial tracking
  - Visible section dividers at /20 opacity
affects: [03.1-02, 03.1-03, all subsequent visual polish plans, Button.tsx focus ring]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - CSS layered gradient background with body fallback background-color
    - SVG feTurbulence data-URI for static film grain via fixed pseudo-element
    - CSS cascade for heading overrides: shared h1–h6 block then individual h1/h2 rules

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - app/globals.css
    - app/page.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Accent color #7a9eb8 muted steel blue: WCAG AA ~5.5:1 against #0a0a0a, visually distinct from previous warm white #fafaf9"
  - "Grain texture via SVG feTurbulence data-URI at opacity 0.035: static (no animation), fixed position, z-index -1"
  - "h1 override after shared heading block: leverages CSS cascade to set 5xl size and editorial tracking without duplicating shared rules"

patterns-established:
  - "body::before grain overlay: position fixed, inset 0, z-index -1, pointer-events none — safe for all content layers"
  - "Editorial tracking token --tracking-editorial -0.035em applied only to h1 and h2, not h3-h6"

# Phase 03.1 Plan 01: Visual Polish Foundations Summary

**Gradient + grain background, muted steel blue accent token, 5xl/editorial-tracking typography tokens, and visible section dividers establishing the design system canvas for all subsequent visual polish work**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-17T00:07:41Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-17T00:09:02Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Replaced flat #0a0a0a background with layered radial+linear gradient giving depth without distraction
- Added SVG feTurbulence film grain overlay (fixed position, opacity 0.035) via body::before pseudo-element
- Replaced warm white accent (#fafaf9) with muted steel blue (#7a9eb8) at WCAG AA ~5.5:1 contrast
- Added --font-size-5xl and --tracking-editorial tokens; overrode h1 (larger, bolder, tighter) and h2 (tighter tracking)
- Fixed 5 invisible section dividers by increasing opacity from /10 to /20

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add background depth, accent color, and typography tokens** - `c28c532` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Fix invisible section dividers** - `06ef564` (fix)

**Plan metadata:** (docs commit follows)

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/globals.css` - Added gradient body background, grain body::before, accent token replacement, 5xl and tracking-editorial tokens, h1/h2 overrides
- `app/page.tsx` - All 5 hr elements changed from border-text-tertiary/10 to /20

## Decisions Made
- Accent color changed to #7a9eb8 muted steel blue: previous warm white (#fafaf9) was indistinct from text-primary (#f5f5f5) at a conceptual level; the blue provides visual contrast and character while remaining WCAG AA compliant
- Film grain is static (no CSS animation): performance and user decision to avoid animated grain
- body::before uses position fixed (not absolute): ensures grain covers full viewport during scroll

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All CSS design tokens are now in place: accent color, 5xl size, editorial tracking, gradient background, grain overlay
- Subsequent plans in phase 03.1 can reference --color-accent, --font-size-5xl, --tracking-editorial without re-establishing them
- Button.tsx focus-visible ring already uses --color-accent and will pick up the blue automatically
- Section dividers are now visible, providing proper visual rhythm between page sections
