<objective>
Create the text-driven content sections: Hero, Intro, Services, Process, and Contact. These are the core narrative sections that form the single-page experience, using existing data files and UI primitives.

Purpose: Deliver the primary content sections that communicate Mira Consultancy's value proposition, services, process, and call-to-action. These sections use typography and spacing to carry the design — no decorative elements.

Output: 5 section components + barrel export, ready for page assembly in Plan 03-03.

  <action>
Create four section components in `components/sections/`. All are React Server Components (no 'use client'). Each uses the design system utilities from globals.css.

**Hero.tsx** (HERO-01, HERO-02, HERO-03):
- `<section>` with `min-h-[70vh] flex items-center section-padding` — partial viewport height per user decision
- Inner `<div className="prose-width">` for content width constraint
- `<p className="section-label mb-8">Mira Consultancy</p>` — subtle branding label
- `<h1 className="mb-6">I build the tools your business actually needs.</h1>` — EXACT headline from HERO-01
- `<p className="text-lg text-text-secondary max-w-[38rem] mb-8">` subline: "Custom applications, AI agents, and workflow automation — built with precision for businesses that need to move fast."
- `<Button href="https://calendly.com/placeholder" external>Let&apos;s talk</Button>` — CTA as styled text link with arrow (per user decision: "CTA as styled text link with arrow — minimal, confident, not a filled button"). The existing Button component already renders as a text link with arrow, which matches this requirement perfectly.
- Do NOT wrap Hero in AnimatedSection — it should be visible immediately on page load (above the fold content)

**Intro.tsx** (INTRO-01):
- `<section className="section-padding">` — no AnimatedSection wrapper (flows as continuation of hero, no visual break per user decision)
- Inner `<div className="prose-width">`
- 3 paragraphs with `text-lg leading-relaxed text-text-secondary` styling:
  1. "I'm Zach, and I build software for businesses that need custom tools but don't have the time or team to build them in-house."
  2. "Since 2018, I've worked with startups, agencies, and scale-ups to design and build internal applications, AI-powered workflows, and technical infrastructure that actually gets used."
  3. "Based in London, working with clients across Europe and North America."
- Each paragraph with `mb-6` except last paragraph (no mb)
- No section-label heading — intro flows as continuation of hero per user decision

**Services.tsx** (SERV-01):
- Import `services` from `@/lib/data/services`
- Import `AnimatedSection` from `@/components/ui`
- Wrap in `<AnimatedSection as="section" stagger className="section-padding">`
- Inner `<div className="prose-width">`
- `<p className="section-label mb-4">What I Do</p>` — subtle muted label per user decision
- `<h2 className="mb-12">Services</h2>`
- `<div className="space-y-10">` — generous spacing between service items
- Map over `services` array, each item renders: `<h3 className="text-xl mb-2">{service.title}</h3>` and `<p className="text-text-secondary">{service.description}</p>`
- No card borders, no grid — minimal text blocks per user decision

**Process.tsx** (PROC-01):
- Import `processSteps` from `@/lib/data/process`
- Import `AnimatedSection` from `@/components/ui`
- Wrap in `<AnimatedSection as="section" stagger className="section-padding">`
- Inner `<div className="prose-width">`
- `<p className="section-label mb-4">How I Work</p>` — subtle label
- `<h2 className="mb-12">Process</h2>`
- `<div className="space-y-10">` — same generous spacing as services for consistency
- Map over `processSteps`, each renders:
  - `<p className="section-label mb-2">{String(step.step).padStart(2, '0')}</p>` — monospace step number
  - `<h3 className="text-xl mb-2">{step.title}</h3>`
  - `<p className="text-text-secondary">{step.description}</p>`
- Simple numbered list approach (Claude's discretion) — consistent with minimal text approach

Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Verify each file exists and exports a named function component. Verify Hero imports Button, Services imports services data, Process imports processSteps data.
  </verify>
  <done>
Four section components exist as React Server Components. Hero displays exact headline with CTA, Intro has 3-paragraph narrative, Services maps 5 offerings, Process maps 4 numbered steps. All use design system utilities (prose-width, section-padding, section-label).

  <name>Task 2: Create Contact section and sections barrel export</name>
  <files>
    components/sections/Contact.tsx
    components/sections/index.ts
  </files>
  <action>
**Contact.tsx** (CTA-01, CTA-02, CTA-03):
- Import `Button` from `@/components/ui`
- Import `AnimatedSection` from `@/components/ui`
- Wrap in `<AnimatedSection as="section" stagger className="section-padding">`
- Inner `<div className="prose-width">`
- `<p className="section-label mb-4">Get in Touch</p>` — subtle label
- `<h2 className="mb-6">Got a problem that needs solving?</h2>` — EXACT headline from CTA-01
- `<p className="text-lg text-text-secondary mb-8 max-w-[38rem]">Ready to discuss your project? Book a discovery call or drop me an email.</p>`
- CTA container: `<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4">`
  - Primary CTA: `<Button href="https://calendly.com/placeholder" external>Get in touch</Button>` — styled text link with arrow per user decision (same style as hero CTA)
  - Email fallback: `<Button href="mailto:hello@mira.co" variant="secondary">hello@mira.co</Button>` — secondary variant (muted text, underline hover, no arrow)
- The CTAs stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on sm+ screens

**sections/index.ts** — Barrel export:
```ts
export { Hero } from './Hero'
export { Intro } from './Intro'
export { Services } from './Services'
export { Process } from './Process'
export { Contact } from './Contact'
```

Note: TechStack, About, and Footer will be added to this barrel in Plan 03-02.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — no TypeScript errors. Verify `components/sections/index.ts` exports all 5 section components. Verify Contact.tsx imports Button from @/components/ui.
  </verify>
  <done>
Contact section component exists with "Got a problem that needs solving?" headline, "Get in touch" primary CTA linking to Calendly, and "hello@mira.co" email fallback. Barrel export at components/sections/index.ts exports Hero, Intro, Services, Process, Contact.
  </done>
</task>
