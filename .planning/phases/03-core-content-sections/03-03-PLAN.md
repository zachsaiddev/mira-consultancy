<objective>
Assemble all section components into the final single-page layout with section dividers, update SEO metadata, and verify the complete responsive experience from 320px to desktop.

Purpose: Deliver the complete single-page experience where a visitor lands on the hero and scrolls through all sections — the primary deliverable of Phase 3.

Output: Working homepage with all 8 sections composed, dividers between sections, and SEO metadata.

  <name>Task 1: Compose all sections in page.tsx with dividers and SEO metadata</name>
  <files>
    app/page.tsx
    app/layout.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Replace `app/page.tsx`** entirely with the final single-page composition:

```tsx
import {
  Hero,
  Intro,
  Services,
  Process,
  TechStack,
  About,
  Contact,
  Footer,
} from '@/components/sections'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen">
      {/* Hero + Intro flow together without divider */}
      <Hero />
      <Intro />

      {/* Dividers between remaining sections */}
      <hr className="border-t border-text-tertiary/10" />
      <Services />

      <hr className="border-t border-text-tertiary/10" />
      <Process />

      <hr className="border-t border-text-tertiary/10" />
      <TechStack />

      <hr className="border-t border-text-tertiary/10" />
      <About />

      <hr className="border-t border-text-tertiary/10" />
      <Contact />

      {/* Footer has its own top border */}
      <Footer />
    </main>
  )
}
```

Key composition decisions per user requirements:
- Hero and Intro flow together WITHOUT a divider (per decision: "Intro section flows as a continuation of the hero — same visual treatment, no break between them")
- `<hr className="border-t border-text-tertiary/10">` between all other sections — 1px, 10% opacity, very subtle (per decision: "Sections separated by subtle thin horizontal divider lines")
- Footer renders last, has its own `border-t` — no external `<hr>` before Footer
- `<main className="min-h-screen">` wraps everything for semantic HTML
- Section components handle their own padding (section-padding utility) — no wrapper divs needed

**Update `app/layout.tsx`** metadata:
- Change `title` to: `'Mira Consultancy — Custom Software for Growing Businesses'`
- Change `description` to: `'I build custom internal applications, AI agents, and workflow automation for startups and scale-ups. Based in London, working globally.'`
- Leave all other layout.tsx content unchanged (fonts, body classes, etc.)

**Verify build:**
- Run `npm run build` to confirm static export succeeds
- Run `npm run dev` and verify the page loads at localhost:3000
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run build` succeeds with no errors. Dev server renders all 8 sections in sequence. Dividers appear between sections (not between Hero/Intro). Footer appears at the bottom.
  </verify>
  <done>
Homepage renders complete single-page experience with all 8 sections in sequence, subtle dividers between sections (not Hero/Intro), and updated SEO metadata. Static export builds successfully.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Visual and responsive verification of complete page</name>
  <files>app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Present the complete page for user verification. What was built: Complete single-page layout with all content sections — Hero (headline + CTA), Intro (positioning narrative), Services (5 offerings), Process (4 steps), Tech Stack (logo row), About (photo + bio), Contact (CTA + email), Footer (copyright + social links). Sections separated by subtle dividers. Fully responsive layout.

Verification steps for user:
1. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000
2. Hero section (top): Headline "I build the tools your business actually needs." with subline and "Let's talk" CTA with arrow (links to calendly.com/placeholder in new tab). Should NOT fill entire viewport — hint of intro section visible below.
3. Scroll down to Intro: 3 paragraphs about Zach and Mira (no section heading, flows from hero). No divider between hero and intro.
4. Scroll to Services (after thin divider line): "What I Do" label, "Services" heading, 5 service titles with descriptions.
5. Scroll to Process (after thin divider): "How I Work" label, "Process" heading, 4 numbered steps (01-04).
6. Scroll to Tech Stack (after thin divider): Subtle row of tech logos, muted/low opacity, brighter on hover.
7. Scroll to About (after thin divider): Photo placeholder + bio text. Desktop: photo left, text right. Mobile: stacked.
8. Scroll to Contact (after thin divider): "Got a problem that needs solving?" headline, "Get in touch" CTA + "hello@mira.co" email link.
9. Footer (bottom): "(c) 2026 Mira Consultancy" + "London, UK" + LinkedIn, GitHub, Email icon links.
10. Responsive test: Chrome DevTools at 320px, 375px, 768px, 1280px — no horizontal overflow, no text truncation.
11. Animations: Sections fade in on scroll, Services and Process have stagger effect.

Resume signal: Type "approved" if the page looks correct, or describe any issues to fix.
  </action>
  <verify>User confirms visual appearance and responsive behavior match requirements.</verify>
  <done>User has approved the complete single-page layout including all sections, dividers, responsive behavior, and animations.</done>
</task>

</tasks>
